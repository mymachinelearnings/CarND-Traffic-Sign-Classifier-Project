Images with lesser light are very hard to distinguish, and if you observe the histogram of image pixels, it will be more concentrated in one area. Histogram equalization is a technique to spread the histogram across the graph which makes a better contrast image. But this poses a problem sometimes where a bright part of the image becomes more brighter. In such cases, a technique called adaptive histogram equalization is used where histogram equalization will be done block wise in the image. This technique is otherwise called CLAHE\n",

    "\n",
    "This took me to modifying the architecture. I've extended Yann LeCun's architecture to have one additional Convolution Layer and 2 additional fully connected layers. This gave me an accuracy of ~95%\n",
    "\n",
    "I further used dropout mechanism to finally achieve an accuracy of ~96% on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this can further be increased by better augmenting the data using various mechanisms like rotation, adjusting brightness, etc. but I think this number is decent enough to have a sense of satisfaction with the project :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes :\n",
    "- Having learning rate as low as possible is better so that the weight adjustments happen properly\n",
    "- I didn't observe much difference with having batch size 128 or 256, hence i've settled for 128\n",
    "- Having more epochs is always a good idea. I had chosen 60 so that it doens't take too much during training and at the same time not too less\n",
    "- observed that having dropout layers only on fully connected layers yeilds more accuracy than to have the dropouts on Convolution layers. The differece is about 1% as observed in about 10 different training cycles\n",

You see the probability is ~45% for this. This is conflicting with the 'Road Work'. This may have hapenned since the model was not able to predict this class accurately with high results - the possible reason could be due to the the lack of variation in the training data.
